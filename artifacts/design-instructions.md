# Design Instructions

These guidelines describe how AI tools should design the Higher/Lower app.

## Visual Tone
- Modern, joyful, and friendly without looking childish.
- Use clean spacing, soft corners, and a balanced layout with clear hierarchy.
- Prefer bold, confident typography paired with a warm supporting font.

## Color
- Use a light, uplifting palette with one vibrant accent.
- Avoid harsh contrast and neon saturation.
- Gradients are allowed but should be subtle and purposeful.

## Layout
- Center the core game content and keep the focus on the comparison.
- Use clear, large callouts for the current choice and results.
- Keep secondary actions smaller and visually quiet.

## Motion and Interaction
- Use animations for state changes, such as round start, reveal, win/lose, and score updates.
- Add hover and focus effects for interactive elements (buttons, cards, choices).
- Animations should be quick and smooth, with easing that feels playful but not bouncy.
- Avoid long or distracting animation loops.

## Components
- Buttons: rounded, with subtle depth (shadow or light border).
- Cards: soft shadow, minimal borders, and clear separation from background.
- Feedback: use short, upbeat microcopy and clear visual signals.

## Accessibility
- Maintain readable contrast for text and key actions.
- Provide clear focus states for keyboard navigation.
- Use motion that is optional or reduced when the user prefers reduced motion.
